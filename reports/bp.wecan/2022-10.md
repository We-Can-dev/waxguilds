The team successfully launched the mobile application (Android and iOS) of the R-Planet game. Nearly 700 testers take part in the closed version of the game. So far the feedback from them is excellent. Using the NFTs in the App is smooth and easy.
Weâ€™ve been doing bugfixes and updates in the App. There were IPADs adoption,  update of Market UI, leaderboard page, etc. We implemented an upgrade cancellation and fixed some minor bugs.  
New features like alliances, ingame chats and others are being developed now for the next server. Also the devs have been working on adjusting the application for running on the browser.
