### Product #4: Contest Giveaway Platform

**URLs**: https://wax.contest.bountyblok.io

**Update** 
* MAJOR update Part 1 or 2: We're in the process of upgrading the Contest Tool from Angular 14 to Angular 20 to enhance performance and overall efficiency. As part of this effort, we're also updating Angular Material to its latest version to improve the UI/UX and provide a more intuitive user experience. All dependent Web3 libraries, including WharfKit, are being upgraded as well, contributing to greater application stability and compatibility. This upgrade involved resolving numerous breaking changes due to the version jump. Aiming to be done by end of July.
* Fixed a bug where updating contest image will fail to update the contest.
* Creators can now use array parameters when setting up Contract Actions tasks.
