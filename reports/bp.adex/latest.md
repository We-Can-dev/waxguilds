### Pixel Journey (https://pixeljourney.xyz)
**List of SCs**: pixeljourney

Docs:(https://docs.pixeljourney.xyz)

Pixel Journey is an innovative new crypto-education focused project starting off from Wax.io, NFT-bridged to both Ethereum, Polygon, Base, and BNB Chain already, soon our goal is to explore all that the Web3 and crypto space has to offer. Together, we'll work towards Pixels binding together endless worlds in our shared metaverse. Explore crypto education, staking, and crafting as we bridge Web3 worlds through pixel-powered collectibles. Season 2 launches this summer!

**Update**

* The first week of the month we visited NFC Summit in Lisbon, where we distributed 250 Pixel Journey (+ NFTOPIA) business card invitations to our Journey, promoted the Wax Ecosystem featuring our merch, onboarded some new users, and distributed a bunch of merch away (that Tommy had sent me for the occasion).
* The following week(s) we've been catching up with new friends/potential future project partners from there, where we've found a couple of projects that could be compatible (with our current schedule, then possibly early next year, if all goes well)
* We've acquired a list of ~2000 event participating wallets (base wallets), that we're still considering what to finally do with, however; It's being considered airdropping them a random Primary Pixel Ingredient each (worth ~50cents each, with value tied to our Pixal PFPs, WPIXAL and PXJ .. so potentially $1000 worth of NFTs), which bridged there includes our links for everything, and might incentivize more to step further into new PXJourneys to begin.
* We crossed a new Community Milestone of +150M PXJ having been locked into our Pixel Ingredient crafts (over 100k WAX worth), and have now already continued to +165M locked up. With a new aim to cross 200M PXJ by our 2nd Anniversary (July 18th)
* Preparations for releasing PxTap (https://pxtap.pixeljourney.xyz/, tieing in on-chain ownership to provide in-game boosters) here for our 2nd Anniversary (July 18th).
* Other preparations for our 2nd anniversary; Bountyblok, Website update(s, in particularly spicing up Pixal trait airdrops), Medium celebrations, new chapters of the journey to take part in (on Wax).
* Our Leaderboard page got a further logic update, and new live Token Distribution stats/graphics for our PXJ, WPIXAL and KING tokens (https://lb.pixeljourney.xyz/)
* We've initiated a new addition to our monthly Pixal PFP holder airdrops; now also extraordinarily airdropping our top (currently ~25) lb.pixeljourney.xyz contenders every month with additional rewards (based on their amount of PXJ locked up in ingredients). The first round of this last month, distributed 5 WPIXAL (~1000-1200 Wax worth) between top participants on that front.
* Preparation, Community brainstorm/feedback and discussions about 10+ possible Pixel Journey WaxLabs grants (for the upcoming year). This far just within our Discords project discussion channels (requiring a Pixal PFP to participate in the debates).
* Additional ~10M $PXJ and ~50 WPIXAL has been allocated towards our DeFi for the coming ~360 days (incentivizing DeFi participation in particular for our PXJ and WPIXAL pools paired with WAX, LSWAX, LSW, WUF, TLM, and most other active ecosystem token economies).

**Metrics**

* Visits: ~1500 (30 days)
* Rewards via farms: ~26M PXJ/monthly; ~6M YEET/monthly; ~10 NFTs/daily
* Rewards for holders via airdrops: ~3M PXJ/month
* Rewards for NFT holders via WaxDAO Staking: ~17.7M PXJ/month; ~85M WUF/month
* Rewards for discord community events: ~1000 WAX/month
