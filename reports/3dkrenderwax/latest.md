### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>

Our Hyperion service on mainnet showed 2 missed blocks. During the repair process, we encountered some issues while attempting to use the hyp-repair tool. These issues were caused by a port configuration problem that occurred because our Hyperion system had been updated from versions prior to the introduction of this repair tool. This is a known issue, so we have added an explanation and solutions to the Hyperion GitHub repository. You can find it here:

[https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-history-api/issues/143](https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-history-api/issues/143)

The missed blocks were successfully recovered.

**Testnet**

On testnet, our Hyperion service experienced a severe incident that required a full reindexing, resulting in almost two days of downtime on January 24-25.
