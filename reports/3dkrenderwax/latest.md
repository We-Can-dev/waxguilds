## Translation of Unity SDK Documentation to Spanish

This PR adds Spanish translations for the Unity SDK section of the WAX Developer documentation, making it more accessible to Spanish-speaking developers.

### Files Translated

- **SDK Overview** (`docs/es/build/cloud-wallet/sdks/unity/index.md`)
  - Complete translation of SDK features, installation instructions, and usage examples
  - Maintained technical accuracy of code samples and configuration details

- **Backend Requirements** (`docs/es/build/cloud-wallet/sdks/unity/dapp-backend.md`)
  - Translation of backend implementation guide and API requirements
  - Preserved code examples and technical parameters
  - Translated configuration details and error handling

- **Repository Structure** (`docs/es/build/cloud-wallet/sdks/unity/repository.md`)
  - Translation of repository organization and component descriptions
  - Maintained directory structure and technical terminology

- **Sample dApp** (`docs/es/build/cloud-wallet/sdks/unity/sample-dapp.md`)
  - Translation of demo implementation guide and functionality examples
  - Preserved demo screenshots and implementation details

- **SDK Implementation Guide** (`docs/es/build/cloud-wallet/sdks/unity/sdk.md`)
  - Comprehensive translation of implementation details, security considerations, and platform-specific setup
  - Maintained code examples, method signatures, and technical parameters
  - Translated error messages and debugging information

### Translation Approach

- Preserved all technical terms, method names, and code syntax
- Maintained consistent terminology across all SDK documentation
- Updated internal documentation links to reference Spanish versions
- Ensured code examples remain functional while translating comments and error messages

This translation work significantly improves accessibility for Spanish-speaking Unity developers working with the WAX Cloud Wallet SDK.
