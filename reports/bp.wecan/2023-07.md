We are pleased to provide you with an update on the development of the R-Planet game. Devs have prepared numerous highly anticipated features and improvements.
 
New Features:

**Alien invasion**
Invasion begins along with player registration or 24 hours after the previous alien invasion. It ends when all resources from the alien base are captured.

**Map now shows combat and support icons**

Players can now easily track incoming attacks and support on their bases, as well as their own outgoing attacks. In addition, they can view attacks on the bases of their alliance members. This enhanced visibility allows players to stay informed and strategically plan their defense and offense in the game.

**Added more options to map filters**

**New leaderboards**

Player information and categories now include valuable insights such as droids, attacking score, defending score, and robbing score.

Boberts, Quasimodos, and Chads were added to the Combat Calculator.

**Time zone in settings**

Players now have the option to choose between using their local time or the server’s time in R-Planet. This flexibility allows for better coordination and collaboration among alliance members, as they can easily synchronize their activities and plan attacks at specific times.


We announced and released two 1,000-player servers “Ahnangs Invasion” with a new map, mechanics and prizes.
